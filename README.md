# Data Science Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my data science projects portfolio! This repository contains a collection of personal projects where I apply various data science techniques and tools to analyze data, extract insights, and build predictive models.

## Project Directory

- **Project 1: Predicting House Prices**
  - **Description**: In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities. I utilized regression techniques and evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared.
  - **Code**:
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

    # Load the dataset
    data = pd.read_csv('house_prices_data.csv')

    # Split the data into features and target variable
    X = data.drop('Price', axis=1)
    y = data['Price']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Initialize and train the linear regression model
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions on the test set
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

    print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)
    print("R-squared:", r2)
    ```
  - **Output**:
    ```
    Mean Squared Error: 26500000.0
    R-squared: 0.75
    ```
