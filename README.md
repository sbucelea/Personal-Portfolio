# Data Science Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my data science projects portfolio! This repository contains a collection of personal projects where I apply various data science techniques and tools to analyze data, extract insights, and build predictive models. Some of my projects include:

## Text Generation with LSTM

This project utilizes LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to generate text based on a given input. LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) particularly effective at learning patterns in sequential data, making them well-suited for text generation tasks.

### Overview

The project comprises several key components:

#### Data Preparation

The text data is preprocessed and tokenized to create input-output pairs for training the LSTM model.

#### Model Training

A Sequential model is constructed using TensorFlow's Keras API. The model consists of two LSTM layers followed by a Dense layer with softmax activation.

#### Text Generation

Given an initial input text, the trained model predicts the next word in the sequence. This process is repeated iteratively to generate longer sequences of text.

### Usage

To utilize the text generation functionality:

#### Data Preparation

Provide a dataset containing the text you wish to train the model on.

#### Model Training

Run the script to train the LSTM model on the provided dataset. Adjust parameters such as batch size, epochs, and model architecture as needed.

#### Text Generation

Use the trained model to generate text by providing an initial input text and specifying the desired length of the generated text. Adjust the creativity parameter to control the diversity of generated text.

## Echography Scan Image Compression with PCA

### Overview

This project focuses on compressing echography scan images using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Echography scan images often contain a vast amount of data, making efficient compression techniques crucial for storage and transmission.

### Implementation

#### Importing Necessary Modules

- OpenCV (cv2) for image processing
- NumPy (np) for numerical operations
- Matplotlib (plt) for visualization
- Scikit-learn's PCA for performing Principal Component Analysis

#### Loading and Preprocessing Images

- Images are loaded and split into their RGB channels.
- Each channel is normalized to the range [0, 1].

#### PCA Compression

- PCA is applied separately to each RGB channel.
- The number of components for PCA compression is fixed.
- Reduced components are used to reconstruct the channels.

#### Result Visualization

- Original and reconstructed channels are displayed side by side for comparison.
- The reconstructed image is formed by merging the reconstructed channels.
