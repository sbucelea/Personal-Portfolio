# Data Science Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my data science projects portfolio! This repository contains a collection of personal projects where I apply various data science techniques and tools to analyze data, extract insights, and build predictive models. Some of my projects include : 


## Text Generation with LSTM
This project utilizes LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to generate text based on a given input. LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) particularly effective at learning patterns in sequential data, making them well-suited for text generation tasks.

Overview
The project comprises several key components:

Data Preparation: The text data is preprocessed and tokenized to create input-output pairs for training the LSTM model.

Model Training: A Sequential model is constructed using TensorFlow's Keras API. The model consists of two LSTM layers followed by a Dense layer with softmax activation.

Text Generation: Given an initial input text, the trained model predicts the next word in the sequence. This process is repeated iteratively to generate longer sequences of text.

Usage
To utilize the text generation functionality:

Data Preparation: Provide a dataset containing the text you wish to train the model on. Ensure the text is preprocessed and tokenized appropriately.

Model Training: Run the script to train the LSTM model on the provided dataset. Adjust parameters such as batch size, epochs, and model architecture as needed.

Text Generation: Use the trained model to generate text by providing an initial input text and specifying the desired length of the generated text. Adjust the creativity parameter to control the diversity of generated text.
